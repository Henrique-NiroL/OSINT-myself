# OSINT-myself

## Build my own path to capture all important data that can be capture of myself online


### Step 1 - Google my Full Name
- A random kid, some laywer without the same name that I have.
- Damn > there is an id with henriqueoliveiracabral on instagram with followers < 10 .... bio goes by "Nothing exists here besids a lonely person" (creap) 
#### Finally! Found my old business registry for freelance jobs in Brasil > NIROL SOLUCOES T.I (request the site to erase all my personal data)
##### And there you go, all of this data available > My address, my email, and my cellphone (INSAAANE)


### Step 2 - Google maps with CNPJ address
- Found the street view of the place that I live.
- If I'm that important... Can we consider garbage dumping? Did I use a car? What could be the best way to reach my apartment doors?


### Step 3 - Let's check if this email was victim of some data leaks > https://haveibeenpwned.com/
- Descomplica: In March 2021, the Brazilian EdTech company Descomplica suffered a data breach which was subsequently posted to a popular hacking forum. The data included almost 5 million email addresses, names, the first 6 and last 4 digits and the expiry date of credit cards, purchase histories and password hashes.
Compromised data: Email addresses, Names, Partial credit card data, Passwords, Purchases
- Well, In that case, someone's might have my facebook and instagram passwords (Thank God all my credit cards are in full debt, no one can use then! lol hahahahahhahaha) > Change my facebook passwd
- If I don't do that > Go to a data breach database (on onion or not) > get that passKey and save it for later.


### Step 5 - Phone Checker > https://freecarrierlookup.com/
- Looks like we found the phone company I use... Can it be sniffed? Spooffed? Both?
- Can we make a cold call?
- Did This phone uses any message app like whatsapp or telegram?
