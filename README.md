# OSINT-myself

## Build my own path to capture sensitive data available online
## Rules:
  - No tools (like sherlock, theHarvester, etc).
  - No advanced google search commands.
  - No WayBack Machine.
  - No additional data should be added to make the search easier.
  - No LinkedIn search or derivated tools.
  - No gaming profiles.
  - No deep web or anything that could be considered as advanced or skilled techniques.
  - The report should be clean, practical, and replicable(at least for Brazilians.
  - Start's with Full Name (ONLY!) > Henrique **** **** ****.
  - Extra: You can start with your own e-mail at most.


### Step 1 - Google my Full Name
- A random kid, some lawyer without the same name that I have.
- Damn > there is an id with henriqueoliveiracabral on Instagram with followers < 10 .... bio goes by "Nothing exists here besides a lonely person" (creep) 
#### Finally! Found my old business registry for freelance jobs in Brasil (request the site to erase all my personal data)
##### And there you go, data found > My address, my email, and my cellphone (INSANE)


### Step 2 - Google maps with CNPJ address
- Found the street view of the place that I live.
- If I'm that important... Can we consider garbage dumping? Did I use a car? What could be the best way to reach my apartment doors?


### Step 3 - Let's check if this email was a victim of some data leaks > https://haveibeenpwned.com/
- Descomplica: In March 2021, the Brazilian EdTech company Descomplica suffered a data breach that was subsequently posted to a popular hacking forum. The data included almost 5 million email addresses, names, the first 6 and last 4 digits, and the expiry date of credit cards, purchase histories, and password hashes.
Compromised data: Email addresses, Names, Partial credit card data, Passwords, Purchases
- Well!!! In that case, someone's might have my Facebook and Instagram passwords > Change my Facebook passwd


### Step 4 - Goes to some data breach database > https://breachaware.com/dashboard
- Search for Descomplica > nothing found.
- Should we look for some .onion hosted databases? NO! Let's keep it simple!


### Step 5 - Google my CNPJ emails
- cas***** .com.br and cn**** .biz I'll be back to dump YOU ALL!!! My CNPJ data belongs to me and should be used only by the government or myself, this type of service has to stop, it's insane.


### Step 6 - Phone Checker > https://freecarrierlookup.com/
- Looks like we found the phone company I use... Can it be used for spoofing attacks? Probably!
- Can we make a cold call? Hell Yeah
- Did This phone uses any messaging app like WhatsApp or telegram? Yeah, both!


### Step 7 - Social Media search
- Instagram: My full name > Nothing! \\\\\ First name + Last Name > (If the social engineer knows myself, he/she found my profile) ID: h***** 1
- Facebook: First name + Last Name > ID: h****l. ***
- Twitter: Try Everything > Nothing Found.
- Instagram data = { Web Dev/ InfoSec, https://henriquecabraldev.vercel.app/, S.I. - UFJF, Rosacruz, Umbanda, Tarot, 22 posts, a relationship with Fernanda, etc }
- Facebook data = { Jr Developer at Naubly, Faefid, CTU - UFJF, and some religious posts, political positioning, family members, etc }
- Capture Places that could be linked to posts.
- Capture some photos to discover where he took them.


### Step 8 - Yandex > https://yandex.com/images/
- Photo 1:
  * before search Infos = { looks like a restaurant, some writings like "Promoção de Costela", some family members marked on the photo, family reunion }
  * after search = Nothing, too many random bar photos on Yandex... But since we already know my personal address > we could google all costela restaurants in my city > Found its name: ***ral.
- Photo 2:
  * before Infos = { soccer team, friends, tons of marked up profiles }
  * after Infos = Nothing, inconclusive.
- Photo 3:
  * before = { Bro's in da club, watching the first big show of L** (linked in photo's description) }
  * after = Nothing.
- Yandex can be a powerful tool but didn't help this time.


### Step 9 - Organize all Data
- Name
- Address
- Phone
- Email
- CNPJ
- Current Work
- Graduation
- Curriculum Vitae Web Page
- Past working places
- Past graduations
- Facebook ID
- Instagram ID
- Whatsapp
- Telegram
- Data breach passwd (If found)
- Phone Company
- Street View of my house
- Photos
- Some family members
- My friends
- My Relationship
- My Religion
- Frater Rosicrucian
- Political positioning
- Places that I used to go
- And More...
- Yandex inconclusive =(


### Step 10 - Delete and Protect the sensitive data.
- Changed my Facebook passwd.
- Request all of those prospect web pages to erase my personal data.
- That's all.


### Extra Step - What you could do next? How you should handle all that personal intel? Would search for more Infos? .... ( USING THESE 10 STEPS IN ANOTHER SEARCH. NOT MYSELF ANYMORE! PLEASE! )
